            <hr>
            <p class="text-justify pt-3">I am a commercial project manager for an electrical company by the name of IES Residential. I am currently enrolled in the University of Utah's computer programming course and will graduate May of 2021. </p>
            <p class="card-text">I am 27 years old and was born on November 4th, 1993 in Salt Lake City, Utah at Pioneer Valley Hospital. I grew up as an only child until my mother surpised me when I was 22 by announcing that she was pregnant with my little sister, Lyric. The funny part about that is that I just so happened to be pregnant as well. Our daughters were born 3 days apart at the same hospital in April of 2016, they are best friends.  My daughter's name is Adaline Annette Hope, and my son that was born two years later, is named Steele Vaughn Hope. My family is very "Standard Utahan" we love anything outdoors! Camping, shooting and boating are my personal favorites.</p>
            <p class="card-text">My passion/ guilty pleasure is playing video games. I started playing "Spyro" when I was about 5 on the very first Playstation and I fell in love. I have beat just about every game that Playstation has to offer, except for "Fear" and "Silent Hill." Only because I can't get anyone to sit in the room with me long enough.</p>
